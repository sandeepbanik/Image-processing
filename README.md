# Image-processing
Various image processing method on matlab and python

## Description
Various image processing function have been developed in Matlab and python. 

The Matlab functions present under demosaic are:
  - CFA filter
  - Demosaic matlab
  - Demosaic linear interpolation
  - Demosaic difference filter
  - Demosaic ratio filter

The Matlab functions present under Image processing are:
  - Smoothing filter
  - Sharpen filter
  - Unsharpen mask
  - High boost filter
  - Sobel filter
  - Laplacian filter

The python functions present under Image processing are:
  - Negative transformation
  - Log transformation
  - Power transformation
  - Gamma correction
  - Histogram equalizer
  - Image histogram


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository. Under Matlab folder run the demosaic_test.m to check various demosaic filters. The Img_pr_test.m contains a demo showing various function of the image processing functions present under the matlab folder.

Run the Image_processing_test.py to check the various functions present under the python folder. A jupyter notebook named Image_processing_test.ipynb is also present.

### Prerequisites

Matlab 2010 or higher
Python 3.x or higher
